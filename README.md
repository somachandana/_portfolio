 In this project, I utilized Logistic Regression to develop a model that predicts the approval status of loan applications. The goal was to identify whether a loan application would be approved or denied based on various applicant characteristics such as credit history, income, loan amount, and other pertinent factors.

The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of news articles and predict whether a given article is fake or real. By employing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and fitting a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of fake news detection. Additionally, text preprocessing and feature extraction were performed to prepare the data for effective model training.

The objective of this project is to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 vaccination and determine the sentiment behind them, categorizing the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. By employing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and fitting a Logistic Regression model, the project aims to accurately predict the sentiment expressed in tweets. This analysis helps understand public opinion and trends regarding COVID-19 vaccination on social media.
